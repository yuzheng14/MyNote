## Unit 1 A new age of economic conflict

**标题**<span style="color:red"></span>

**The West has imposed crushing sanctions on Russia. The implications are huge**

**第一段**

**【1】Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could yet become the biggest military action in Europe since 1945.**

**【2】It also marks a new era of high-risk economic warfare that could further splinter the world economy.**

**【3】The measures the West has imposed on Russia are so potent that they have triggered chaos in its $1.6trn economy and prompted the president, Vladimir Putin, to issue nuclear threats.**

**【4】The instant immiseration of a big economy is unprecedented and will cause alarm around the world.**

**【5】The West’s priority must be to win the economic confrontation with Russia. **

**【6】Then it must create a doctrine to govern these weapons in order to prevent a broader shift towards autarky.**

**第二段**

**【1】The fact that Russia did not take the threat of sanctions seriously at first is no surprise.**

**【2】For years they have been plentiful but ineffective.**

**【3】Reluctant to use hard power, America and Europe have reached for economic penalties instead.**

**【4】Some 10,000 people or firms are subject to American sanctions, affecting over 50 countries with 27% of world GDP, and covering everything from torture to cryptocurrencies.**

**【5】Often they make little difference. **

**【6】Autocrats can evade targeted measures.**

**【7】Full embargoes on Iran and Venezuela have been crippling but not toppled regimes.**

**【8】The deterrent effect has been weak, as malefactors have assumed that America would never apply “maximum pressure” on a big economy.**

**第三段**

**【1】On February 26th that Rubicon was crossed, when sanctions were imposed on the world’s 11th-biggest economy.**

**【2】By making it illegal for Western firms to deal with big Russian banks, except in the energy trade, and expelling them from the global-payments plumbing, the flow of money across borders is seizing up.**

**【3】Action against Russia’s central bank means it cannot gain access to much of its vast $630bn pile of foreign reserves.**

**【4】Confidence has evaporated. **

**【5】The rouble has fallen by 28% this year as capital flees, threatening soaring inflation.**

**【6】Russian share prices have dropped by over 90% in offshore trading, and multinationals are leaving. **

**【7】From Moscow to Murmansk, Russians are queuing outside banks.**

**第四段**

**【1】The shock could lead to a coup or a cash-crunch that impedes the war machine. **

**【2】But Mr Putin could retaliate with his own economic weapons including strangling the flow of gas. **

**【3】After nuclear bombs were used in 1945, it took years to develop a doctrine to govern how to deal with retaliation. **

**【4】Now, amid the chaos, there is no time for an equivalent for sanctions. **

**【5】One principle is clear, though: any Russian economic retaliation must be met by a more damaging response by the West that makes that act of retaliation irrational. **

**【6】Through its ability to stymie tech services and oil exports (from which Russia earns four times more than gas) the West has the advantage.**

**第五段**

**【1】If the West faces down Russia, and cements the new weapons’ deterrent power, the long-run implications will be daunting. **

**【2】The more they are used, the more countries will seek to avoid relying on Western finance. **

**【3】That would make the threat of exclusion less powerful. **

**【4】It would also lead to a dangerous fragmentation of the world economy. **

**【5】In the 1930s a fear of trade embargoes was associated with a rush to autarky and economic spheres of influence.**

**第六段**

**【1】Autocracies will be most nervous: they own half of the world’s $20trn pile of reserves and sovereign wealth assets. **

**【2】Although China can inflict huge economic costs on the West by blocking supply chains, it is now clear that in the event of a war over Taiwan, the West could freeze China’s $3.3trn reserve pile. **

**【3】Even some democracies like India, which has avoided condemning Russia’s invasion, may worry they are more vulnerable to Western pressure. **

**【4】Over the next decade technological changes could create new payments networks that bypass the Western banking system. **

**【5】China’s digital-currency trial has 261m users. **

**【6】Today it is hard to park trillions of dollars outside Western markets, but in time more countries may seek to diversify their reserves by investing more elsewhere.**

**第七段**

**【1】Some of this fragmentation has become inevitable. **

**【2】But by applying sanctions to ever more countries over the past two decades, and now also raising their potential severity, the West risks pushing more countries to delink from the Western-led financial system than is desirable. **

**【3】That is why after the crisis in Ukraine passes, the West should aim to make clear how sanctions will be controlled. **

**【4】The relentless proliferation of the low-level sort ought to be contained, although targeted measures against individuals and firms for human-rights abuses remain legitimate, even if they rarely work. **

**【5】And it should be made clear that economy-wide sanctions of the devastating kind being used against Russia are reserved for the worst acts of aggression and war. **

**【6】The West has deployed an economic weapon that was until recently unthinkable. **

**【7】It must be used wisely.**

**回译**

**【1】进城务工的民工被大量的就业机会、医疗和教育资源，以及逃离枯燥的农业生活所吸引。**

**【2】培养积极的人际关系帮助他摆脱孤独感。**

**【3】有碍于释放创新活力的繁文缛节，要下决心砍掉。**

**【4】在上世纪三十年代，由于担心贸易禁运，各国纷纷转向了自给自足的经济模式，并构建自己的经济势力范围。**

**写作仿写**

**【1】多家快时尚品牌离开中国并不令人意外。多年来，由于成本较低、在线平台的崛起以及更符合当地市场的新鲜设计，本土品牌大受欢迎。**

**【2】在无症状感染者激增的情况下，上海市政府终于下决心封城。**

**【3】在一个充斥着腐败的社会，乌克兰人民投票选出了一位演员总统。这位演员称，他想把自己在荧幕上的形象变成现实。**

**【4】关于小花梅事件的调查，官方的通告前后不一。因此，省政府随后派出了一个专家小组。**

**【5】在上海封城期间，食物供给是头等大事。**

**【6】为了回收各种材料，首要任务就是要对垃圾进行分类。**

**【7】疫苗，加上部分隔离，可以帮助大多数人逃离病毒。**

**【8】科学加上有利政策，可以帮助农村人口在自然灾害中保持就业、确保生产和安全。**

**【8】假如大型科技公司进行裁员，很多程序员应该找好退路。**

**【9】如果爆发新冠疫情，很多婚礼将延期举行。**

**【10】现在，孩子接受了太多的关爱。**

**【11】女孩比人们认为的那样更擅长数学。**
