## Unit 1 A new age of economic conflict

**标题**<span style="color:red"></span>

**The West has imposed crushing sanctions on Russia.The implications are huge**

**第一段**

**【1】Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could yet become the biggest military action in Europe since 1945.**

**【2】It also marks a new era of high-risk economic warfare that could further splinter the world economy.**

**【3】The measures the West has imposed on Russia are so potent that they have triggered chaos in its $1.6trn economy and prompted the president, Vladimir Putin, to issue nuclear threats.**

**【4】The instant immiseration of a big economy is unprecedented and will cause alarm around the world.**

**【5】The West’s priority must be to win the economic confrontation with Russia.**

**【6】Then it must create a doctrine to govern these weapons in order to prevent a broader shift towards autarky.**

**第二段**

**【1】The fact that Russia did not take the threat of sanctions seriously at first is no surprise.**

**【2】For years they have been plentiful but ineffective.**

**【3】Reluctant to use hard power, America and Europe have reached for economic penalties instead.**

**【4】Some 10,000 people or firms are subject to American sanctions, affecting over 50 countries with 27% of world GDP, and covering everything from torture to cryptocurrencies.**

**【5】Often they make little difference.**

**【6】Autocrats can evade targeted measures.**

**【7】Full embargoes on Iran and Venezuela have been crippling but not toppled regimes.**

**【8】The deterrent effect has been weak, as malefactors have assumed that America would never apply “maximum pressure” on a big economy.**

**第三段**

**【1】On February 26th that Rubicon was crossed, when sanctions were imposed on the world’s 11th-biggest economy.**

**【2】By making it illegal for Western firms to deal with big Russian banks, except in the energy trade, and expelling them from the global-payments plumbing, the flow of money across borders is seizing up.**

**【3】Action against Russia’s central bank means it cannot gain access to much of its vast $630bn pile of foreign reserves.**

**【4】Confidence has evaporated.**

**【5】The rouble has fallen by 28% this year as capital flees, threatening soaring inflation.**

**【6】Russian share prices have dropped by over 90% in offshore trading, and multinationals are leaving.**

**【7】From Moscow to Murmansk, Russians are queuing outside banks.**

**第四段**

**【1】The shock could lead to a coup or a cash-crunch that impedes the war machine.**

**【2】But Mr Putin could retaliate with his own economic weapons including strangling the flow of gas.**

**【3】After nuclear bombs were used in 1945, it took years to develop a doctrine to govern how to deal with retaliation.**

**【4】Now, amid the chaos, there is no time for an equivalent for sanctions.**

**【5】One principle is clear, though: any Russian economic retaliation must be met by a more damaging response by the West that makes that act of retaliation irrational.**

**【6】Through its ability to stymie tech services and oil exports (from which Russia earns four times more than gas) the West has the advantage.**

**第五段**

**【1】If the West faces down Russia, and cements the new weapons’ deterrent power, the long-run implications will be daunting.**

**【2】The more they are used, the more countries will seek to avoid relying on Western finance.**

**【3】That would make the threat of exclusion less powerful.**

**【4】It would also lead to a dangerous fragmentation of the world economy.**

**【5】In the 1930s a fear of trade embargoes was associated with a rush to autarky and economic spheres of influence.**

**第六段**

**【1】Autocracies will be most nervous: they own half of the world’s $20trn pile of reserves and sovereign wealth assets.**

**【2】Although China can inflict huge economic costs on the West by blocking supply chains, it is now clear that in the event of a war over Taiwan, the West could freeze China’s $3.3trn reserve pile.**

**【3】Even some democracies like India, which has avoided condemning Russia’s invasion, may worry they are more vulnerable to Western pressure.**

**【4】Over the next decade technological changes could create new payments networks that bypass the Western banking system.**

**【5】China’s digital-currency trial has 261m users.**

**【6】Today it is hard to park trillions of dollars outside Western markets, but in time more countries may seek to diversify their reserves by investing more elsewhere.**

**第七段**

**【1】Some of this fragmentation has become inevitable.**

**【2】But by applying sanctions to ever more countries over the past two decades, and now also raising their potential severity, the West risks pushing more countries to delink from the Western-led financial system than is desirable.**

**【3】That is why after the crisis in Ukraine passes, the West should aim to make clear how sanctions will be controlled.**

**【4】The relentless proliferation of the low-level sort ought to be contained, although targeted measures against individuals and firms for human-rights abuses remain legitimate, even if they rarely work.**

**【5】And it should be made clear that economy-wide sanctions of the devastating kind being used against Russia are reserved for the worst acts of aggression and war.**

**【6】The West has deployed an economic weapon that was until recently unthinkable.**

**【7】It must be used wisely.**

**回译**

**【1】进城务工的民工被大量的就业机会、医疗和教育资源，以及逃离枯燥的农业生活所吸引。**

**【2】培养积极的人际关系帮助他摆脱孤独感。**

**【3】有碍于释放创新活力的繁文缛节，要下决心砍掉。**

**【4】在上世纪三十年代，由于担心贸易禁运，各国纷纷转向了自给自足的经济模式，并构建自己的经济势力范围。**

**写作仿写**

**【1】多家快时尚品牌离开中国并不令人意外。多年来，由于成本较低、在线平台的崛起以及更符合当地市场的新鲜设计，本土品牌大受欢迎。**

**【2】在无症状感染者激增的情况下，上海市政府终于下决心封城。**

**【3】在一个充斥着腐败的社会，乌克兰人民投票选出了一位演员总统。这位演员称，他想把自己在荧幕上的形象变成现实。**

**【4】关于小花梅事件的调查，官方的通告前后不一。因此，省政府随后派出了一个专家小组。**

**【5】在上海封城期间，食物供给是头等大事。**

**【6】为了回收各种材料，首要任务就是要对垃圾进行分类。**

**【7】疫苗，加上部分隔离，可以帮助大多数人逃离病毒。**

**【8】科学加上有利政策，可以帮助农村人口在自然灾害中保持就业、确保生产和安全。**

**【8】假如大型科技公司进行裁员，很多程序员应该找好退路。**

**【9】如果爆发新冠疫情，很多婚礼将延期举行。**

**【10】现在，孩子接受了太多的关爱。**

**【11】女孩比人们认为的那样更擅长数学。**

## Unit 2 China tweaks its covid strategy

**标题**

**【1】China tweaks its covid strategy**

**【2】Beating the Omicron variant will require more vaccinations and less fear**

**第一段**

**【1】FOR MOST of the covid-19 pandemic, a bargain based on tough love has bonded China’s rulers and people.**

**【2】Leaders have imposed tight controls on an unlucky minority—meaning anyone hapless enough to cross paths or live near someone with covid, or even to be a close contact of these close contacts.**

**【3】Such unfortunates face being quarantined for days or weeks.**

**【4】Right now mainland China is enduring its first big outbreak of the Omicron variant, and the ranks of the unlucky have grown rapidly.**

**【5】At least 40m people are under some form of lockdown, including an entire province, Jilin.**

**【6】The southern metropolis of Shenzhen confined most residents to their homes except for trips to buy food, though it prefers the term “life on pause” to “lockdown”.**

**【7】Some border cities have spent months cut off from the rest of China.**

**第二段**

**【1】In return for those sacrifices by the unlucky, a majority of China’s 1.4bn people have spent most of the pandemic leading relatively normal lives.**

**【2】As a result, it is common to hear ordinary folk praise strict covid controls.**

**【3】Even now, reported case numbers remain low by global standards, with about 3,000 new infections detected nationwide on March 15th, compared with 26,000 found on the same day in America.**

**【4】Keeping China mostly covid-free has cost residents a good deal of privacy.**

**【5】Those with smartphones must scan QR codes to enter public buildings or catch a taxi, train or domestic flight.**

**【6】The simplest walk in the park is logged by movement-tracking public-health apps installed on those same phones.**

**【7】The costs also include isolation from the world, for China has all but closed its borders for nearly two years.**

**第三段**

**【1】Still, Chinese leaders are not shy about proclaiming this strategy, which they call their “dynamic zero-covid” policy, an act of love.**

**【2】They say it is proof that the Communist Party cares for all its people.**

**【3】They contrast China with countries such as America that have chosen to “live with covid” in the name of individual liberties, amid horrifying numbers of deaths.**

**【4】The party’s love has a paternalist edge.**

**【5】Because officials risk the sack for cases found on their watch, they compete to invent ever-stricter rules.**

**【6】Like overprotective parents, authorities have treated suspected cases as medical emergencies.**

**【7】Anyone who develops a fever, for any reason, is meant to head to a fever clinic for hours of covid-detecting nasal swabs, chest scans and blood tests.**

**第四段**

**【1】With the party’s governing legitimacy bound up with keeping China covid-free and death numbers very low, leaders have to date rejected suggestions that they will have to change course, especially if that advice comes from foreigners.**

**【2】After inspecting pop-up quarantine clinics in Jilin, Sun Chunlan, a deputy prime minister, told officials to grit their teeth and “win the battle of epidemic prevention, control and eradication”.**

**【3】For all the defiant talk, there are signs that the authorities are ready to adjust their methods.**

**【4】Success in this endeavour comes with preconditions.**

**【5】Most important, to avoid a political crisis at home China will have to avoid the high death rates currently seen in its semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong.**

**【6】The virus has exacted a grim toll on the city’s unvaccinated old people, a category that is also dangerously large in the mainland.**

**【7】Even if China can avoid mass fatalities, the whole population is going to experience the pandemic differently.**

**【8】If China’s covid bargain is to survive the Omicron strain, the public will have to accept a version that feels more tough and less loving.**

**第五段**

**【1】Many Chinese are strikingly frightened of catching covid, after so many months of reports about pandemic deaths in the selfish, decadent West.**

**【2】The disease carries a stigma that extends beyond its impact on health.**

**【3】People who test positive know that many neighbours and work colleagues, and perhaps their child’s schoolmates, too, will be quarantined on their account.**

**第六段**

**【1】Yet Omicron spreads so fast that tracking systems are flagging too many close contacts to fit into hospitals.**

**【2】New guidelines from the National Health Commission duly state that patients with mild symptoms will be monitored in isolation sites, rather than in clinics or hospitals.**

**【3】In the name of treatment rather than prevention, China has approved an antiviral medicine, Paxlovid, made by an American firm, Pfizer.**

**【4】Netizens have responded with panic, tinged with nationalism.**

**【5】An alarmist blog post by a student at Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University declared that youngsters were “waiting to die” after being told to quarantine together amid a covid scare.**

**【6】It was viewed hundreds of millions of times.**

**【7】Reports of Paxlovid’s approval drew angry comments about its foreign origins, such as one asking: “900,000 Americans died from covid, is this medicine any good?”**

**第七段**

**【1】Officials are not becoming less strict.**

**【2】During recent lockdowns, some people faced quarantine for receiving a package sent from a city with cases, for instance.**

**【3】But officials are sounding less tolerant of some fears.**

**【4】Health chiefs have called for greater efforts to get the elderly vaccinated, noting that two-thirds of Chinese with severe covid are aged over 60, and two-thirds of those sick mature folk have not had jabs.**

**【5】Anti-Western propaganda does not help: official media have repeatedly cast doubt on the safety of mRNA shots used abroad.**

**【6】To date only Chinese-made vaccines have been approved in the country.**

**【7】Although they offer decent protection against severe disease and death, they do not prevent infection—and thus do little to stop the virus spreading.**

**第八段**

**【1】Public fear has suited officials, helping to drive compliance with disruptive controls.**

**【2】Omicron poses a new test, being more contagious but less lethal than earlier variants.**

**【3】If authorities are not ready to open the country, they will need millions of Chinese to feel safe if told to isolate while mildly ill but not in a hospital.**

**【4】To achieve an exit strategy one day, they will need the public to trust potent, imported treatments.**

**【5】After shamefully concealing the start of this pandemic, Chinese officials acted like stern parents for two years.**

**【6】Now, they need to treat their people like adults.**

**回译**

**【1】抗击奥密克荣变异株，需要提升疫苗接种率，减少担忧。**

**【2】在南方大都市——深圳，除了出去购买食物外，大多数居民都要被限制在家中。尽管官方更喜欢用“生活暂停”这个词，而不是“封锁”。**

**【3】中国愿与各国携手合作、同舟共济，为促进世界持久和平与共同发展做出新的贡献。**

**【4】即使是现在，报告的病例数量仍然低于全球平均水平。3月15日，全国新增病例约为3000例，而美国当天新增病例为26000例。**

**【5】如果封城长达一年，美国和欧元区的GDP将损失约三分之一。**

**写作**

**【1】为应对奥密克戎BA2亚型病毒，上海的封锁政策进行了调整。**

**【2】为保证新能源汽车的安全驾驶，相关部门要调整法规。**

**【3】女性不应只局限于家庭责任。她们有权利追求更高的学位，追求高薪工作，像男人一样追求理想的生活。**

**【4】乡村生活远不像社交媒体上展示的那样诗情画意。**

**【5】中国男足远不及女足优秀。**

## Unit 3 This leader is amazing!! #ad

**标题**

**【1】This leader is amazing!! #ad**

**【2】Social influencers are becoming a serious business**

**第一段**

**【1】IT IS A sure sign that a hot trend has reached the mainstream when the tax authorities catch up.**

**【2】This week China promised a tax-evasion crackdown on social-media influencers, who are paid by brands to promote products online to armies of followers.**

**【3】One of the big stars, Viya, a 30-something fashionista known as the live-streaming queen, has already been fined $210m for not declaring her income.**

**【4】The size of that levy shows the sheer scale of the industry, which accounts for 12% of online sales in China.**

**【5】Outside China, influencers are also likely to have an enduring role in e-commerce.**

**【6】For all firms with brands—and together those brands are worth over $7trn—it is time to realise that influencing is more than just a hobby.**

**第二段**

**【1】The use of personal endorsements used to be about harnessing existing celebrity power.**

**【2】Elizabeth Taylor touted Colgate-Palmolive’s shampoo in the 1950s, and Michael Jordan’s deal in 1984 with Nike revolutionised both basketball and branding.**

**【3】Influencers turn the logic on its head: selling things helps make them more famous.**

**【4】Through curated feeds of clipped videos and filtered photos they offer recommendations to consumers, mingled with glimpses into their daily lives that give their artifice an aura of authenticity.**

**【5】Sometimes they disclose how they are paid.**

**【6】Often they do not.**

**第三段**

**【1】Initially dismissed as credulous Gen-Z folk who had mistaken posting selfies for having a job, these entrepreneurs have become a big business, boosted further by the e-commerce surge from the pandemic.**

**【2】Total spending on influencers by brands could reach $16bn this year.**

**【3】Whereas the number of wannabe influencers outside China is in the millions, an elite of under 100,000 of them who have over 1m followers each get the bulk of revenues and the front seats at fashion shows.**

**第四段**

**【1】Their staying power suggests that they add value in several ways.**

**【2】They can save money: Elon Musk is an honorary influencer whose raucous online presence lets Tesla do without any conventional advertising (General Motors blew $3.3bn on it in 2021).**

**【3】Influencers’ networks reach new audiences, particularly younger shoppers.**

**【4】Global brands can localise their appeal by cutting deals with them.**

**【5】In China local shopping festivals and style sensibilities matter, so transplanting marketing campaigns from the West does not work.**

**【6】And influencers are technologically proficient in a way that old-style brand ambassadors never were.**

**【7】They are quick to adapt to newer platforms like TikTok and to the ever-changing algorithms of older ones like Instagram.**

**第五段**

**【1】Yet one-third of brands do not use influencers.**

**【2】They worry about tarnishing their reputation.**

**【3】Having a swarm of freelance advocates is riskier than the command-and-control campaigns of the “Mad Men” era.**

**【4】And the industry is a Wild West, awash with fraud and manipulation.**

**第六段**

**【1】Despite this, ignoring influencers is a mistake.**

**【2】Their share of digital advertising budgets is still low at perhaps 3%, but it is rising fast.**

**【3】The boundary between entertainment and e-commerce is blurring.**

**【4】And the most popular marketing strategy of the 2010s—ads targeted through Google and Facebook—is under threat as new privacy standards, including on Apple’s iPhone, make it harder to spy on potential customers.**

**第七段**

**【1】To get the most out of influencers, brands should set a clear strategy.**

**【2】They should expect more regulation on consumer protection: China’s crackdown may also include limits on spending and content rules.**

**【3】The guiding principle should be to use only influencers who disclose to their audiences that their posts are paid.**

**【4】As the Wild West phase ends, brands should also embrace new analytical tools that help them gauge the performance of influencers, sorting the con-artists from the stars.**

**【5】It used to be said that only half of all advertising spending worked, but it was impossible to know which half.**
