## 作文

### 结构相关

#### 作文如何开篇？如何引出话题？

先交代整体情况，通过 XX is no exception 来引出要描述的主题。

> In much of the world the business of running ski slopes has, like most of tourism, been crippled by lockdowns and travel restrictions. China is no exception.

#### 如何介绍正反双方的观点？

Are sth. really adj. ? sb. are split.

The case for the defence is that... . Defenders argue... .

The prosecution retorts that... .

1. 先通过设问引出议题，指出争议
2. 用词 be split 比 different people have different opinions 更”高大上“。
3. 通过”The case for the defence is that...“ ”defenders argue... ”引出辩护方（支持者）的观点
4. 通过“The prosecution retorts that...”引出指控方（反对者）的观点，其中 prosecution 和前面的 defenders 相对应；retort 比 think/believe 态度更加鲜明，更能体现出双方针锋相对的局面。

#### 如何分析问题？

Start with XX problems ...

A second concern is ...

A third worry is ...

1. 摆脱了 first, second, third 这种俗套用法，取而代之的是 start with, a second, a third 这种更新颖的说法。
2. 用不同的词 problem, concern, worry 表达同一个含义。在写作中，这三个词以及 risk 都是可以相互替换的。

#### 如何表达“激烈讨论”的含义？

Nowhere does debate rage more fiercely about XX than in YY. 关于 XX，YY 的讨论最为激烈，XX 为讨论的内容，YY 为讨论的地点。
