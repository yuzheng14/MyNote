## 作文

### 结构相关

#### 作文如何开篇？如何引出话题？

先交代整体情况，通过 XX is no exception 来引出要描述的主题。

> In much of the world the business of running ski slopes has, like most of tourism, been crippled by lockdowns and travel restrictions. China is no exception.

#### 如何介绍正反双方的观点？

Are sth. really adj. ? sb. are split.

The case for the defence is that... . Defenders argue... .

The prosecution retorts that... .

1. 先通过设问引出议题，指出争议
2. 用词 be split 比 different people have different opinions 更”高大上“。
3. 通过”The case for the defence is that...“ ”defenders argue... ”引出辩护方（支持者）的观点
4. 通过“The prosecution retorts that...”引出指控方（反对者）的观点，其中 prosecution 和前面的 defenders 相对应；retort 比 think/believe 态度更加鲜明，更能体现出双方针锋相对的局面。

#### 如何分析问题？

Start with XX problems ...

A second concern is ...

A third worry is ...

1. 摆脱了 first, second, third 这种俗套用法，取而代之的是 start with, a second, a third 这种更新颖的说法。
2. 用不同的词 problem, concern, worry 表达同一个含义。在写作中，这三个词以及 risk 都是可以相互替换的。

#### 练习

翻译：25-30岁的未婚女人为“圣斗士”，30岁以上为“斗战胜佛”，35岁以上为“齐天大圣”。

讲解：这句话看似很难，“圣斗士”“斗战胜佛”“齐天大圣”，乱七八糟的……其实，翻好一句话，我们不能逐词转化（因为英语和汉语的思维逻辑不同，逐词翻译老外看不懂），而要理解这句话的“内在含义”，然后把“内在含义”表达出来。这句话“圣斗士”“斗战胜佛”“齐天大圣”，看上去很复杂，其实表达的都是一个意思：未婚女性的年龄越大，越不被社会所接纳，所以我们把这层意思表达出来就可以

> The older an unmarried woman is, the more she is unaccepted by society.
>
> The older an unmarried woman is, the more she is despised.
>
> The older an unmarried woman is, the more she is looked down on.

>The older an unmarried woman is, the more she is demonized.
>
>demonize 源自 demon（妖魔），意思是“将……妖魔化”

## 地道表达

### be met by/with

泛指“遭遇、遇到”

后面可以加 applause，enemy，critics，support/approval，opposition/disapproval，success，failure

可使行文更加地道

We have finally achieved success after hard work.  
→Our hard work has finally been met with success.

We have won some support with our ideas.  
→Our ideas have been met with some support.
